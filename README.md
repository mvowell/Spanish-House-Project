# Spanish-House-Project
A Unity game made back in spring 2016 for high school spanish 2.

Pls do not judge my coding, modeling, or Spanish-speaking ability with this project, it was made when I was 16.

This project features a five story house, complete with Spanish translated descriptions for every floor and most rooms. Press keys 1-5 to move between floors. Click each room to read the description for the room. Press esc key to exit the game.
